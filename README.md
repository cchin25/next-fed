# next-foundry

**A production-grade Turborepo template for self-hosted and air-gapped Next.js deployments.**

## âœ¨ Overview

[next-foundry](https://github.com/cchin25/next-foundry) is a **Next.js boilerplate** built for teams who need full control over their deployments.  
Inspired by [next-forge](https://github.com/vercel/next-forge) which leans heavily on external SaaS, **next-foundry** focuses on tools that can be **self-hosted, run in air-gapped environments, or deployed securely without internet access.**

This makes it an ideal starting point for **federal, enterprise, or private cloud applications** where independence and security come first.

## ðŸ”’ Features

- âœ… Deploy seamlessly to **private cloud** or **air-gapped** environments  
- âœ… **SSL enabled** out of the box  
- âœ… Built-in **mTLS support** for secure service communication  
- âœ… Fully **containerized** for consistent, portable deployments  

## ðŸš§ Status
